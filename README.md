# omxserver
Minimum web server playing video files on a Raspberry Pi using omxplayer

The "itch" this scratches is ability to hook a Raspberry Pi to a TV via HDMI that hosts video files. This server allows those files to
be played back using a web interface. 

There is an Android project, Raspicast, that does similar. However, there is no IPhone version of it and I wanted family members to be able 
to play back video on such devices without installing any application and just use a browser.
